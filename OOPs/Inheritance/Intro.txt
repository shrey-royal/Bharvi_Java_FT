5 Types of Inheritance:

1. Single Inheritance : One parent -> One child
2. Multiple Inheritance (Not supported in Java using classes, but supported using interfaces) : Multiple parent -> One child
3. Multilevel Inheritance : One parent -> One child -> One grand child -> ....
4. Hierarchical Inheritance : One parent -> Multiple child
